main.cpp:
  With 2D buffer, each matrix is accessed with 2D array access (e.g. [][]) in the kernel
  
  
main_opt.cpp:
  With 1D buffer, each matrix is accessed with 1D array access in the kernel.
  However, the ndrange is still 2D. The global 2D range is "range<2>(grid_rows, grid_cols)".
  In the kernel, the column index is returned using item.get_global_id(1) and the row index item.get_global_id(0)
  
  In DPCT code, the global 3D range is "range<3>(grid_cols, grid_rows, 1)". 
  In the kernel, the column index is returned using item.get(2) and the row index item.get(1). 
  In both cases, grid_col is the range located at the highest dimension!
  The highest dimension corresponds to the fastest index.
